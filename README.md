# AgriSense-IoT
 AgriSense is an IoT-based solution designed to automate the monitoring and control of environmental conditions in agricultural setups such as hydroponics, greenhouses, and farms. This project ensures optimal crop growth by using sensors to track temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light, and pH levels.
